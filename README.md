# DemonGirls
Helltaker demake for Gamebuino Meta.

https://gamebuino.com/fr

This is a puzzle game inspired by the famous « Sokoban », with a little more complexity.

« When demon girls are involved, no price is high enough. » You said, as you ventured down to Hell.

This is the story of the Helltaker, a guy who passes deadly trials to date horny horned ladies.

The original game was made by VanRipper (free on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1289310/Helltaker/)

« Demon Girls » t-shirts and stickers are available here: https://juicelizard.myspreadshop.fr/

New levels in Heaven are now available. And the sprites in the dialogues are now 32x32 pixels.

You can make your own levels or graphics by modifying the source code.

Thank you for playing, and take a look at my other artworks: http://www.juicelizard.com/
