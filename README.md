Helltaker demake for Gamebuino Meta
It is a puzzle game inspired by the famous « Sokoban », with a little more complexity.
« When demon girls are involved, no price is high enough. » You said, as you ventured down to hell.
This is the story of the Helltaker, a guy who passes deadly trials to date horny horned ladies.
The original game was made by VanRipper (and is available on Steam for free).

« Demon Girls » t-shirts will be available soon.
New levels in heaven are on the to do list (with the original « Sokoban » gameplay).
You can make your own level design or graphics by modifying the source code.
Thank you for playing and feel free to see my other artworks:
